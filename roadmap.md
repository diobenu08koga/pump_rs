# Roadmap

- [ ] implement dynamic tipping
- [ ] see if can rewrite this to a single service without a http server, just a listener solely in rust
- [ ] see if can trim the amount of token since every buy ends up being the same amount for some reason (in shitter units)
- [ ] analyze the competitors
- [ ] find a suitable exit strategy, possibly dev sells
